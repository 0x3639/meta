# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the HyperCore One Meta repository - an organizational governance and documentation repository, not a traditional code project. It serves as the canonical home for HyperCore One's organizational records, governance documents, architectural decision records (ADRs), SIG charters, and other community operation artifacts.

## Key Information

- **Purpose**: Documentation and governance repository for the HyperCore One project
- **License**: MIT
- **Current State**: Initial repository setup with minimal structure

## Working with This Repository

Since this is a documentation repository, the primary tasks will involve:

1. **Creating and organizing documentation** - ADRs, SIG charters, governance documents
2. **Maintaining consistent formatting** - Use Markdown for all documentation
3. **Structuring content** - Create appropriate directories as the repository grows

## Expected Directory Structure

When creating new content, consider organizing it in these directories:
- `adrs/` - Architectural Decision Records
- `sigs/` - Special Interest Group charters
- `governance/` - Governance guidelines and policies
- `principles/` - Foundational principles and values

## Documentation Standards

When creating new documentation:
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Include appropriate frontmatter or headers
- Follow consistent Markdown formatting
- Consider adding a table of contents for longer documents
